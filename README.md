# Python Template

My FastAPI application template, heavily inspired by [this best practices repository](https://github.com/zhanymkanov/fastapi_production_template), but with some changes of my own, it includes built-in:

- **uv:** a fast and versatile package manager.
- **Pytest:** a testing framework.
- **Ruff:** for linting and code formatting.
- **GitHub Actions:** for automated workflows.
